# 10 状态码定义

下面内容所定义的状态码（包括对应的请求方法），均可应用于响应内容的元信息中。

<a name="10.1" />
## 10.1 1XX

这一类状态码表示当前的响应是临时性的，相应内容中之包含了 **状态行（Status-Line）**和可选的请求头，并以空行结束。对于这类状态码来说，并没有必要的请求头。由于HTTP/1.0协议并没有定义`1XX`状态码，因此，服务器 **禁止**向使用HTTP/1.0协议的客户端发送`1XX`状态码，除非是在试验场景下。

在接收到普通响应之前，即使客户端并不期望接收`100`（Continue）状态消息，也 **必须**准备好接收一个或多个`1XX`状态的响应。用户端 **可能会（MAY）**忽略`1XX`状态的响应。

除非是客户端与代理系统之间的连接被断开，又或者该`1XX`状态的响应是由代理系统本身生成的，否则代理系统 **必须（MUST）**转发`1XX`状态的响应。例如，如果代理系统在转发请求时，添加了域`Expect: 100-continue`，则不需要将该`100(Continue)`状态的响应转发给客户端。

<a name="10.1.1" />
### 10.1.1 100 Continue

客户端 **应该（SHOULD）**继续发送请求。当前的响应只是用来通知客户端，服务器已经接收到请求的初始部分，没有将之拒绝。客户端 **应该（SHOULD）**继续发送请求的剩余部分，如果请求已经全部放松完毕，则忽略该响应。在完整接收请求后，服务器 **必须（MUST）**给客户端发送一个最终响应。更多详细内容，参见[8.2.3][1]

### 10.1.2 101 Switching Protocols

服务器可以理解并愿意听从客户端的请求，根据`Upgrade`消息头（参见[14.42][2]）中指定的内容，在当前连接中切换所使用的协议。在发送完该101响应的最后一个空行后，服务器愿意切换到该响应中的`Upgrade`消息头所指定的协议。

只有当真的有益处的时候，才 **应该（SHOULD）**切换协议。例如，将HTTP协议切换到高版本，或者在传输资源时，切换到具有实时、同步特性的协议等等。

<a name="10.2" />
## 10.2 Successful 2xx

该类状态码用于表示，服务器成功的收到、理解、接收了客户端请求。

<a name="10.2.1" />
### 10.2.1 200 OK

表示请求成功。随着该响应而返回的信息依据请求方法（request method）的不同而有所区别，例如：

* **GET** 返回与请求资源相关的实体（entity）
* **HEAD** 返回与请求资源相关的实体头（entity-header），但不会返回消息体（message-body）
* **POST** 返回描述或包含了动作结果的实体（entity）
* **TRACE** 返回服务器接收到的请求消息

<a name="10.2.2" />
### 10.2.2 201 Created

请求执行成功，并创建了新的资源。在创建了对象后，可以在响应中返回指向新资源的URI(S)，并设置`Location` 请求头。服务器 **应该（SHOULD）**在响应中加入资源的特性和位置信息，以便用户或用户代理方便使用，响应中实体的格式有请求`Content-Type`指定。服务器 **必须（MUST）**在创建了资源之后，才能返回状态码 **201（Created）**。如果服务器无法立即执行创建操作，则 **应该（SHOULD）**返回响应码 **202（Accepted）**。

在返回`201（Created）`的响应中，**可能会（MAY）**包含有请求头`ETag`，用于标记新创建的资源，详情参见[14.19节][3]。

<a name="10.2.3" />
10.2.3 202 Accepted

服务器已经接受请求，但还未执行完成。但到最后，该请求也未必会执行完成，因为可能会在执行过程中被终止。针对此种异步操作，现在还没有重发状态码的机制。

返回响应码202表示请求还未完成，其目的是使服务器可以接受请求来完成其他处理（例如每天执行一次的批处理操作），而无需使客户端一直等到操作完成。在返回202的响应中，**应该（SHOULD）**包含有指示请求当前状态，以及可以使用户预估操作何时完成的信息的。

10.2.4 203 Non-Authoritative Information

实体头（entity-header）中返回的元数据信息集合并非是服务器的原始信息，而是来自于本地货第三方的靠背。该集合 **可能是（MAY）**服务器原始信息子集或超集。例如，如果在请求头中加入本地注解信息，服务器就能藉由这个元信息的超集来了解到相关信息。并不强制要求使用该响应码，响应码不是 **200(OK)**的时候才考虑是否使用。

10.2.5 204 No Content

服务器完成请求，但不需要返回实体，而只需要返回更新后的元信息。在响应内容中 **可能会（MAY）**以实体头的形式来包含新的或更新过的元信息，如果在响应中包含了这些元信息，它们 **应该（SHOULD）**与请求信息中的变量相对应。

如果客户端是用户代理，则它 **不应该（SHOULD NOT）**改变引发当前请求的文档视图。返回204的响应主要用于在不改变当前活动文档视图的前提下接收用户输入（不过新增加的或更新过的信息还是 **应该（SHOULD）**应用于当前视图的）。

**禁止（MUST NOT）**在返回204的响应中添加响应体，因此，在请求头之后的第一个空行处，响应就结束了。

10.2.6 205 Reset Content

返回次响应码说明，服务器已经完成了用户请求，用户代理 **应该（SHOULD）**重置引发请求的文档视图。该响应码主要用于使用户可以发送请求完成相应动作。在返回该响应码的响应中，**禁止（MUST NOT）**添加响应体。

10.2.7 206 Partial Content

服务器已经处理针对指定资源所发出的的 **部分GET（partial GET）*请求，返回响应数据。在此种情况下，请求头中 **必须（MUST）**包含`Range`属性域（参见[14.35节][4]）来指明期望的范围，此外，请求头中 **可能会（MAY）**包含`If-Range`属性域（参见[14.27节][5]）限制数据范围。

响应中 **必须（MUST）**包含以下请求头：

* `Content-Range`（参见[14.16节][6]，用于指定响应体重数据的范围），或`Content-Type`加`Content-Range`来指定每一个分片。如果在响应中加入了`Content-Length`请求头，则其值 **必须（MUST）**与响应体中实际传输的字节数相同。
* `Date`
* `ETag`或`Content-Location`。如果在同一个请求中，要返回状态码为200的响应，则 **必须（MUST）**添加此请求头。
* `Expires` `Cache-Control`或`Vary`，在请求参数相同的情况下，如果结果值可能与之前发送的响应不同的话，则需要添加此请求头。

如果带有`If-Range`请求头的请求使用强缓存校验器（参见[13.3.3节][7]），并且返回响应码206，则在该响应中 **不应该（SHOULD NOT）**包含其他实体头；同样的请求，如果使用的是弱校验器，则在响应中 **禁止（MUST NOT）**添加其他实体头。这样就可以避免了缓存的实体头和更新后实体头不一致的问题。除上述情况外，在返回206的响应中 **必须（MUST）**包含与返回200的同一个请求中相同的所有请求头。

如果`ETag`或`Last-Modified`请求头（参见[13.5.4节][8]）的值与先前响应中对应的请求头的值不能完全匹配的话，则 **禁止（MUST NOT）**将返回206的响应与之前缓存过的内容相关联。

如果缓存不支持`Range`和`Content-Range`请求头，则 **禁止（MUST NOT）**缓存响应码为206的响应内容。

10.3 Redirection 3xx

   This class of status code indicates that further action needs to be
   taken by the user agent in order to fulfill the request.  The action
   required MAY be carried out by the user agent without interaction
   with the user if and only if the method used in the second request is
   GET or HEAD. A client SHOULD detect infinite redirection loops, since
   such loops generate network traffic for each redirection.

      Note: previous versions of this specification recommended a
      maximum of five redirections. Content developers should be aware
      that there might be clients that implement such a fixed
      limitation.

10.3.1 300 Multiple Choices

   The requested resource corresponds to any one of a set of
   representations, each with its own specific location, and agent-
   driven negotiation information (section 12) is being provided so that
   the user (or user agent) can select a preferred representation and
   redirect its request to that location.

   Unless it was a HEAD request, the response SHOULD include an entity
   containing a list of resource characteristics and location(s) from
   which the user or user agent can choose the one most appropriate. The
   entity format is specified by the media type given in the Content-
   Type header field. Depending upon the format and the capabilities of




Fielding, et al.            Standards Track                    [Page 61]
 
RFC 2616                        HTTP/1.1                       June 1999


   the user agent, selection of the most appropriate choice MAY be
   performed automatically. However, this specification does not define
   any standard for such automatic selection.

   If the server has a preferred choice of representation, it SHOULD
   include the specific URI for that representation in the Location
   field; user agents MAY use the Location field value for automatic
   redirection. This response is cacheable unless indicated otherwise.

10.3.2 301 Moved Permanently

   The requested resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any
   future references to this resource SHOULD use one of the returned
   URIs.  Clients with link editing capabilities ought to automatically
   re-link references to the Request-URI to one or more of the new
   references returned by the server, where possible. This response is
   cacheable unless indicated otherwise.

   The new permanent URI SHOULD be given by the Location field in the
   response. Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the
   response SHOULD contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to
   the new URI(s).

   If the 301 status code is received in response to a request other
   than GET or HEAD, the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the
   request unless it can be confirmed by the user, since this might
   change the conditions under which the request was issued.

      Note: When automatically redirecting a POST request after
      receiving a 301 status code, some existing HTTP/1.0 user agents
      will erroneously change it into a GET request.

10.3.3 302 Found

   The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI.
   Since the redirection might be altered on occasion, the client SHOULD
   continue to use the Request-URI for future requests.  This response
   is only cacheable if indicated by a Cache-Control or Expires header
   field.

   The temporary URI SHOULD be given by the Location field in the
   response. Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the
   response SHOULD contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to
   the new URI(s).







Fielding, et al.            Standards Track                    [Page 62]
 
RFC 2616                        HTTP/1.1                       June 1999


   If the 302 status code is received in response to a request other
   than GET or HEAD, the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the
   request unless it can be confirmed by the user, since this might
   change the conditions under which the request was issued.

      Note: RFC 1945 and RFC 2068 specify that the client is not allowed
      to change the method on the redirected request.  However, most
      existing user agent implementations treat 302 as if it were a 303
      response, performing a GET on the Location field-value regardless
      of the original request method. The status codes 303 and 307 have
      been added for servers that wish to make unambiguously clear which
      kind of reaction is expected of the client.

10.3.4 303 See Other

   The response to the request can be found under a different URI and
   SHOULD be retrieved using a GET method on that resource. This method
   exists primarily to allow the output of a POST-activated script to
   redirect the user agent to a selected resource. The new URI is not a
   substitute reference for the originally requested resource. The 303
   response MUST NOT be cached, but the response to the second
   (redirected) request might be cacheable.

   The different URI SHOULD be given by the Location field in the
   response. Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the
   response SHOULD contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to
   the new URI(s).

      Note: Many pre-HTTP/1.1 user agents do not understand the 303
      status. When interoperability with such clients is a concern, the
      302 status code may be used instead, since most user agents react
      to a 302 response as described here for 303.

10.3.5 304 Not Modified

   If the client has performed a conditional GET request and access is
   allowed, but the document has not been modified, the server SHOULD
   respond with this status code. The 304 response MUST NOT contain a
   message-body, and thus is always terminated by the first empty line
   after the header fields.

   The response MUST include the following header fields:

      - Date, unless its omission is required by section 14.18.1







Fielding, et al.            Standards Track                    [Page 63]
 
RFC 2616                        HTTP/1.1                       June 1999


   If a clockless origin server obeys these rules, and proxies and
   clients add their own Date to any response received without one (as
   already specified by [RFC 2068], section 14.19), caches will operate
   correctly.

      - ETag and/or Content-Location, if the header would have been sent
        in a 200 response to the same request

      - Expires, Cache-Control, and/or Vary, if the field-value might
        differ from that sent in any previous response for the same
        variant

   If the conditional GET used a strong cache validator (see section
   13.3.3), the response SHOULD NOT include other entity-headers.
   Otherwise (i.e., the conditional GET used a weak validator), the
   response MUST NOT include other entity-headers; this prevents
   inconsistencies between cached entity-bodies and updated headers.

   If a 304 response indicates an entity not currently cached, then the
   cache MUST disregard the response and repeat the request without the
   conditional.

   If a cache uses a received 304 response to update a cache entry, the
   cache MUST update the entry to reflect any new field values given in
   the response.

10.3.6 305 Use Proxy

   The requested resource MUST be accessed through the proxy given by
   the Location field. The Location field gives the URI of the proxy.
   The recipient is expected to repeat this single request via the
   proxy. 305 responses MUST only be generated by origin servers.

      Note: RFC 2068 was not clear that 305 was intended to redirect a
      single request, and to be generated by origin servers only.  Not
      observing these limitations has significant security consequences.

10.3.7 306 (Unused)

   The 306 status code was used in a previous version of the
   specification, is no longer used, and the code is reserved.










Fielding, et al.            Standards Track                    [Page 64]
 
RFC 2616                        HTTP/1.1                       June 1999


10.3.8 307 Temporary Redirect

   The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI.
   Since the redirection MAY be altered on occasion, the client SHOULD
   continue to use the Request-URI for future requests.  This response
   is only cacheable if indicated by a Cache-Control or Expires header
   field.

   The temporary URI SHOULD be given by the Location field in the
   response. Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the
   response SHOULD contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to
   the new URI(s) , since many pre-HTTP/1.1 user agents do not
   understand the 307 status. Therefore, the note SHOULD contain the
   information necessary for a user to repeat the original request on
   the new URI.

   If the 307 status code is received in response to a request other
   than GET or HEAD, the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the
   request unless it can be confirmed by the user, since this might
   change the conditions under which the request was issued.

10.4 Client Error 4xx

   The 4xx class of status code is intended for cases in which the
   client seems to have erred. Except when responding to a HEAD request,
   the server SHOULD include an entity containing an explanation of the
   error situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent
   condition. These status codes are applicable to any request method.
   User agents SHOULD display any included entity to the user.

   If the client is sending data, a server implementation using TCP
   SHOULD be careful to ensure that the client acknowledges receipt of
   the packet(s) containing the response, before the server closes the
   input connection. If the client continues sending data to the server
   after the close, the server's TCP stack will send a reset packet to
   the client, which may erase the client's unacknowledged input buffers
   before they can be read and interpreted by the HTTP application.

10.4.1 400 Bad Request

   The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed
   syntax. The client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without
   modifications.








Fielding, et al.            Standards Track                    [Page 65]
 
RFC 2616                        HTTP/1.1                       June 1999


10.4.2 401 Unauthorized

   The request requires user authentication. The response MUST include a
   WWW-Authenticate header field (section 14.47) containing a challenge
   applicable to the requested resource. The client MAY repeat the
   request with a suitable Authorization header field (section 14.8). If
   the request already included Authorization credentials, then the 401
   response indicates that authorization has been refused for those
   credentials. If the 401 response contains the same challenge as the
   prior response, and the user agent has already attempted
   authentication at least once, then the user SHOULD be presented the
   entity that was given in the response, since that entity might
   include relevant diagnostic information. HTTP access authentication
   is explained in "HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access
   Authentication" [43].

10.4.3 402 Payment Required

   This code is reserved for future use.

10.4.4 403 Forbidden

   The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it.
   Authorization will not help and the request SHOULD NOT be repeated.
   If the request method was not HEAD and the server wishes to make
   public why the request has not been fulfilled, it SHOULD describe the
   reason for the refusal in the entity.  If the server does not wish to
   make this information available to the client, the status code 404
   (Not Found) can be used instead.

10.4.5 404 Not Found

   The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI. No
   indication is given of whether the condition is temporary or
   permanent. The 410 (Gone) status code SHOULD be used if the server
   knows, through some internally configurable mechanism, that an old
   resource is permanently unavailable and has no forwarding address.
   This status code is commonly used when the server does not wish to
   reveal exactly why the request has been refused, or when no other
   response is applicable.

10.4.6 405 Method Not Allowed

   The method specified in the Request-Line is not allowed for the
   resource identified by the Request-URI. The response MUST include an
   Allow header containing a list of valid methods for the requested
   resource.




Fielding, et al.            Standards Track                    [Page 66]
 
RFC 2616                        HTTP/1.1                       June 1999


10.4.7 406 Not Acceptable

   The resource identified by the request is only capable of generating
   response entities which have content characteristics not acceptable
   according to the accept headers sent in the request.

   Unless it was a HEAD request, the response SHOULD include an entity
   containing a list of available entity characteristics and location(s)
   from which the user or user agent can choose the one most
   appropriate. The entity format is specified by the media type given
   in the Content-Type header field. Depending upon the format and the
   capabilities of the user agent, selection of the most appropriate
   choice MAY be performed automatically. However, this specification
   does not define any standard for such automatic selection.

      Note: HTTP/1.1 servers are allowed to return responses which are
      not acceptable according to the accept headers sent in the
      request. In some cases, this may even be preferable to sending a
      406 response. User agents are encouraged to inspect the headers of
      an incoming response to determine if it is acceptable.

   If the response could be unacceptable, a user agent SHOULD
   temporarily stop receipt of more data and query the user for a
   decision on further actions.

10.4.8 407 Proxy Authentication Required

   This code is similar to 401 (Unauthorized), but indicates that the
   client must first authenticate itself with the proxy. The proxy MUST
   return a Proxy-Authenticate header field (section 14.33) containing a
   challenge applicable to the proxy for the requested resource. The
   client MAY repeat the request with a suitable Proxy-Authorization
   header field (section 14.34). HTTP access authentication is explained
   in "HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication"
   [43].

10.4.9 408 Request Timeout

   The client did not produce a request within the time that the server
   was prepared to wait. The client MAY repeat the request without
   modifications at any later time.

10.4.10 409 Conflict

   The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current
   state of the resource. This code is only allowed in situations where
   it is expected that the user might be able to resolve the conflict
   and resubmit the request. The response body SHOULD include enough



Fielding, et al.            Standards Track                    [Page 67]
 
RFC 2616                        HTTP/1.1                       June 1999


   information for the user to recognize the source of the conflict.
   Ideally, the response entity would include enough information for the
   user or user agent to fix the problem; however, that might not be
   possible and is not required.

   Conflicts are most likely to occur in response to a PUT request. For
   example, if versioning were being used and the entity being PUT
   included changes to a resource which conflict with those made by an
   earlier (third-party) request, the server might use the 409 response
   to indicate that it can't complete the request. In this case, the
   response entity would likely contain a list of the differences
   between the two versions in a format defined by the response
   Content-Type.

10.4.11 410 Gone

   The requested resource is no longer available at the server and no
   forwarding address is known. This condition is expected to be
   considered permanent. Clients with link editing capabilities SHOULD
   delete references to the Request-URI after user approval. If the
   server does not know, or has no facility to determine, whether or not
   the condition is permanent, the status code 404 (Not Found) SHOULD be
   used instead. This response is cacheable unless indicated otherwise.

   The 410 response is primarily intended to assist the task of web
   maintenance by notifying the recipient that the resource is
   intentionally unavailable and that the server owners desire that
   remote links to that resource be removed. Such an event is common for
   limited-time, promotional services and for resources belonging to
   individuals no longer working at the server's site. It is not
   necessary to mark all permanently unavailable resources as "gone" or
   to keep the mark for any length of time -- that is left to the
   discretion of the server owner.

10.4.12 411 Length Required

   The server refuses to accept the request without a defined Content-
   Length. The client MAY repeat the request if it adds a valid
   Content-Length header field containing the length of the message-body
   in the request message.

10.4.13 412 Precondition Failed

   The precondition given in one or more of the request-header fields
   evaluated to false when it was tested on the server. This response
   code allows the client to place preconditions on the current resource
   metainformation (header field data) and thus prevent the requested
   method from being applied to a resource other than the one intended.



Fielding, et al.            Standards Track                    [Page 68]
 
RFC 2616                        HTTP/1.1                       June 1999


10.4.14 413 Request Entity Too Large

   The server is refusing to process a request because the request
   entity is larger than the server is willing or able to process. The
   server MAY close the connection to prevent the client from continuing
   the request.

   If the condition is temporary, the server SHOULD include a Retry-
   After header field to indicate that it is temporary and after what
   time the client MAY try again.

10.4.15 414 Request-URI Too Long

   The server is refusing to service the request because the Request-URI
   is longer than the server is willing to interpret. This rare
   condition is only likely to occur when a client has improperly
   converted a POST request to a GET request with long query
   information, when the client has descended into a URI "black hole" of
   redirection (e.g., a redirected URI prefix that points to a suffix of
   itself), or when the server is under attack by a client attempting to
   exploit security holes present in some servers using fixed-length
   buffers for reading or manipulating the Request-URI.

10.4.16 415 Unsupported Media Type

   The server is refusing to service the request because the entity of
   the request is in a format not supported by the requested resource
   for the requested method.

10.4.17 416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable

   A server SHOULD return a response with this status code if a request
   included a Range request-header field (section 14.35), and none of
   the range-specifier values in this field overlap the current extent
   of the selected resource, and the request did not include an If-Range
   request-header field. (For byte-ranges, this means that the first-
   byte-pos of all of the byte-range-spec values were greater than the
   current length of the selected resource.)

   When this status code is returned for a byte-range request, the
   response SHOULD include a Content-Range entity-header field
   specifying the current length of the selected resource (see section
   14.16). This response MUST NOT use the multipart/byteranges content-
   type.

RFC 2616                        HTTP/1.1                       June 1999


10.4.18 417 Expectation Failed

   The expectation given in an Expect request-header field (see section
   14.20) could not be met by this server, or, if the server is a proxy,
   the server has unambiguous evidence that the request could not be met
   by the next-hop server.

10.5 Server Error 5xx

   Response status codes beginning with the digit "5" indicate cases in
   which the server is aware that it has erred or is incapable of
   performing the request. Except when responding to a HEAD request, the
   server SHOULD include an entity containing an explanation of the
   error situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent
   condition. User agents SHOULD display any included entity to the
   user. These response codes are applicable to any request method.

10.5.1 500 Internal Server Error

   The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it
   from fulfilling the request.

10.5.2 501 Not Implemented

   The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the
   request. This is the appropriate response when the server does not
   recognize the request method and is not capable of supporting it for
   any resource.

10.5.3 502 Bad Gateway

   The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid
   response from the upstream server it accessed in attempting to
   fulfill the request.

10.5.4 503 Service Unavailable

   The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a
   temporary overloading or maintenance of the server. The implication
   is that this is a temporary condition which will be alleviated after
   some delay. If known, the length of the delay MAY be indicated in a
   Retry-After header. If no Retry-After is given, the client SHOULD
   handle the response as it would for a 500 response.

      Note: The existence of the 503 status code does not imply that a
      server must use it when becoming overloaded. Some servers may wish
      to simply refuse the connection.

10.5.5 504 Gateway Timeout

   The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a
   timely response from the upstream server specified by the URI (e.g.
   HTTP, FTP, LDAP) or some other auxiliary server (e.g. DNS) it needed
   to access in attempting to complete the request.

      Note: Note to implementors: some deployed proxies are known to
      return 400 or 500 when DNS lookups time out.

10.5.6 505 HTTP Version Not Supported

   The server does not support, or refuses to support, the HTTP protocol
   version that was used in the request message. The server is
   indicating that it is unable or unwilling to complete the request
   using the same major version as the client, as described in section
   3.1, other than with this error message. The response SHOULD contain
   an entity describing why that version is not supported and what other
   protocols are supported by that server.
